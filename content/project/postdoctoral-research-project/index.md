**Control of nanofriction properties via phonon engineering**

It is one of the cutting-edge challenges for the development of a sustainable society to understand the physical mechanisms of the origin of friction, thereby exploring the potential methods for the control of the frictional properties of materials. 
It is of great significance to explore the origin of friction by developing the understanding of the mechanisms of energy dissipation at the nanoscale, in which process phonon scattering may play a key role -- which forms the topic of the current study.
