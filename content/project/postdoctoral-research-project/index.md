**Control of nanofriction properties via phonon engineering**

To understand the physical mechanisms for the origin of friction, and exploit the potential methods for controlling friction properties of the materials is one of the cutting-edge challenges for the sustainable society development. 
Fundamental knowledge for controlling the nanofriction is to understand the energy dissipation mechanism, where phonon may play a key role, forms the topic of the current study
