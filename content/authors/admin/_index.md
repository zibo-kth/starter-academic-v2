Zibo Liu is ... (to be updated)

I summarize my research into the following keywords: Acoustics; Vibroacoustics; Acoustic/elastic wave propagation; Sound insulation and absorption; Sound radiation; Structural analysis; Finite Element method; Signal analysis, Acoustic measurement.

During my doctoral research, I mainly focused on the subject of vibroacoustics, especially the vibroacoustic behaviour of acoustic metamaterials, with the aim to improve the sound insulation performance of different types of structures through a metamaterial design. 
The research was based on the theoretical investigation and numerical simulation. My doctoral thesis is a compilation work of my publications, entitled: Design of Soundproof Panels via Metamaterial Concept. 
In the process of conducting my doctoral research, I have learnt how to identify, analyze and solve research-related problems. 
I also developed relevant knowledge, research methods and methodology. 

My research contributions from this project are recognized by scholars in the field, which are briefly introduced as follows. 
A metamaterial design was proposed for sandwich structures in order to improve the sound insulation performance in the low frequency range. 
Structures that are widely used in industries but have obvious disadvantages in acoustic performance were also studied respectively, such as double walls, curved panels and curved double walls. 
The general idea was to improve the low sound transmission loss in certain frequency regions associated with these structures by adding resonators. 
These studies eventually led to four peer-reviewed journal articles. 
I also gave several presentations with respect to this topic at some international conferences. 

In addition to the research on acoustic metamaterial, I have broad and strong interests in different research fields of acoustics. 
I am continually following the cutting-edge research in e.g. wave phenomena and metamaterials, topological acoustics, acoustic holography, machine learning in acoustics, building acoustics, music acoustics, etc., and reviewing latest publications via Google Scholar Alert.

All in all, my research experiences may thus be highlighted with mathematical skills, theoretical knowledge, simulation and experimental abilities in acoustics. 
Further competencies of mine like creativity, critical thinking, communication, and problem solving to find and develop creative solutions for the complex research problems may also be reflected. To pursue a PhD is never easy. 
What I cherish most from this journey are: i) Keep the objectives in mind, ii) Always think from the perspective of physics, iii) The strategy of reducing big, blur targets into small, achievable goals, iv) Always be a independent thinker and a good team worker. 
With this treasure, I am ready to learn new things and take any challenges in the future.
